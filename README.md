# CPSC481

Contains assignments and project from CPSC 481 - Human-Computer Interaction: Foundations and Principles, taken in Spring 2017 at the University of Calgary.

## Assignment Descriptions
### A1 
Basic "Hello World" WPF application. Slider changes the opacity of the text, and the button toggles the two colors of the text. 
### A2
WPF application with two tabs: timer and stopwatch. Timer takes input in form of hours/minutes/seconds (and parses it to meaningful output; eg. 120 seconds is parsed into 00:02:00), and counts down. Time text changes from black to red during the last 3 seconds. Stopwatch has a lap function, that records the current time of the stopwatch. Timer and stopwatch can be run concurrently. 
### A3
WPF application to view and organize images. Images are dragged and dropped in from Windows Explorer, and are resized to 100x100. Images can be dragged within the canvas, and are arranged in a grid when "Sort" is pressed.
### A4
A design problem (How should we design technology to provide ambient awareness of in-home energy usage?) is analyzed. An IDEO method from each of the four IDEO categories are chosen and justified. IDEO methods' application are also explained, along with how they complement one another.

## Project Description
A team based project in designing and prototyping a visual web browser for people affected by cerebral palsy. Deliverables throughout the user centered design process are included in the project folder. 

(Media in markdown files are linked to original fork by team member Jan Warncke, backups are in folders)
### P0
Team contract.

### P1
User research. Project idea defined, as well as stakeholders/users. Initial user research was done using IDEO methods, and potential task descriptions were created.

### P2
Ideation and low fidelity prototypes (video prototype, storyboard, affinity diagrams from tutorial). Also included is a task centered system walkthrough.

### P3
High fidelity prototypes and heuristic evaluation. Three tasks were carried out within the hi-fi prototype developed in Axure RP 8. Heuristic evaluations were carried out individually, and compiled together.

### P4
Final report and presentation. A formal report "to the shareholders" explaining the entire process.
