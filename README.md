# CPSC481

Repo contains assignments from CPSC 481 - Human-Computer Interaction: Foundations and Principles, taken in Spring 2017 at the University of Calgary.

## Assignment Descriptions
### A1 
Basic "Hello World" WPF application. Slider changes the opacity of the text, and the button toggles the two colors of the text. 
### A2
WPF application with two tabs: timer and stopwatch. Timer takes input in form of hours/minutes/seconds (and parses it to meaningful output; eg. 120 seconds is parsed into 00:02:00), and counts down. Time text changes from black to red during the last 3 seconds. Stopwatch has a lap function, that records the current time of the stopwatch. Timer and stopwatch can be run concurrently. 
### A3
WPF application to view and organize images. Images are dragged and dropped in from Windows Explorer, and are resized to 100x100. Images can be dragged within the canvas, and are arranged in a grid when "Sort" is pressed.
### A4
A design problem (How should we design technology to provide ambient awareness of in-home energy usage?) is analyzed. An IDEO method from each of the four IDEO categories are chosen and justified. IDEO methods' application are also explained, along with how they complement one another.
